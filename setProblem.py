"""
For this problem, you will be creating three sets. 

You will use the hash function that has been built in. 

You will also create a union and intersection of two sets. 
"""

"""
Problem 1
Create a set that contains strings and floats.
You will need to use the hash method that python has built in. 
"""
# Your code here. 

"""
Problem 2
Create two sets that contains a list of numbers.
TIP: Do regular integers instead of floats. It will make your life easier.
They need to have a little overlap so that some integers are listed twice. 
One in each set. 
"""
# Your code here. 

"""
Problem 3
Create a union of the two sets. 
If done correctly, it will show the numbers from both sets in one set. 
"""
# Your code here.

"""
Problem 4
Create an intersection of the two sets. 
If done correctly, it will show what numbers both sets have in common.
