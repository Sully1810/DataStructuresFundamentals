# Stacks - Fundatemental Data Structure
<!-- Created the basic outline. Need to add information.-->

## Introduction
### What is a stack?
A stack is a data structure. 
Whether something is a stack is determined by the order that items are added or removed. 
The order is based on the principle "Last In, First Out".

### How does the stack work?
To make our principle of "Last In, First Out" easier to understand, think of a stack of books.
<!-- Insert book image. -->

<!-- Rest of explantion -->
The book on the bottom will have been the first book in the pile. 
The book on the top will be the last book added onto the pile. 
However, to reach the book on the bottom, you will have to take the books off the top of the pile first. 
Hence our principle of "Last In, First Out".

## Undoing in Stacks
A common usage of Stacks is the undo function in processors and editors.
